## Goal

The goal of a GitHub Copilot Activate is to learn how to use it, using an exercise that consist of building a web server using Nodejs with different functionalities and a .NET Web API.

 Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write better code faster. It uses machine learning models trained on billions of lines of code to suggest whole lines or entire functions based on the context of what youâ€™re working on. By using Copilot, you can learn how to write better code and improve your productivity.

Remember:

- As you type GitHub Copilot will make suggestions, you can accept them by pressing Tab.
- If nothing shows up after Copilot write some lines , press enter and wait a couple of seconds.
- On Windows, MacOS or Linux, press Ctrl + Enter, then click Open GitHub Copilot.
